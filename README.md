# Spring AOP Tutorial - Mini Project

This is a simple project to demonstrate the basics of Spring Framework's Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). The project uses Spring Boot and includes examples of logging method execution time using an `@Aspect`.

## Introduction
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Spring enables developers to separate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management. In this tutorial, we create a simple example of logging the execution time of service methods.
